Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis:

Introduction:

In today’s digital world, understanding people’s sentiments which are expressed on social media has become important. Sentiment Analysis is a branch of natural language processing and machine learning, which plays a key role in decoding the emotional tone and personal opinions expressed in text. Our project deals with sentiment analysis, with a focus on multilingual datasets covering both English and Hindi ( Popular Language in India) . Social media has completely changed how we communicate by giving us lots of content created by users, which includes what people think and how they feel.

 

Objectives:

To develop a robust machine learning algorithm for analyzing the text
Add the feature of the sentiment analysis to the model  using suitable algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
Use N-grams to capture data and improve the performance of the model.
Train the model using some part of the data from the chosen dataset.
Test the model using the part from the remaining dataset.
 

Data Collection: 

The data collection is done by selecting a suitable dataset which has linguistic diversity ( i.e English and Hindi) from Kaggle. These datasets provide accurate sentiment labels for training and assessing models. Remove irrelevant data(noise) from the dataset if any.

 

Machine Learning Models: 

The machine learning models we use in this project are Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression . We will also use N-grams for enhanced text representation.

Outcomes:

Robust sentiment analysis model which is capable of analyzing text of proposed languages.
Sentiment Analysis.
